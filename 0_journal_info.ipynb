    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a structured analysis of three research journals focusing on pharmacoepidemiological methodologies. The primary emphasis is on the **Sessa Empirical Estimator (SEE)**, a novel data-driven approach for estimating prescription durations.\n",

    "## **Journal 1: Rationale and Performances of a Data-Driven Method for Computing the Duration of Pharmacological Prescriptions Using Secondary Data Sources**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Authors:**\n",
    "**Laura Pazzagli, David Liang, Morten Andersen, Marie Linder, Abdul Rauf Khan, and Maurizio Sessa**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "- Introduces and evaluates the **Sessa Empirical Estimator (SEE)**, a machine learning-based approach to estimating pharmacological prescription durations when direct information is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Methods:**\n",
    "- Utilizes a **k-means clustering algorithm** to estimate prescription durations by analyzing **temporal distances between successive prescription fills**.\n",
    "- Validated using **simulated data** and **real-world data** from Danish healthcare registries.\n",
    "- Compared to the **Researcher-Defined Duration (RDD) method**, a traditional approach based on medication consumption assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Findings:**\n",
    "- **In simulated data:** SEE achieved **96% accuracy** in determining prescription durations.\n",
    "- **In real-world data:** Sensitivity ranged from **78% to 95%**, depending on the drug under study.\n",
    "- Compared to RDD, SEE had a **lower median sensitivity (by 2.29%)**, but exhibited **greater accuracy and reduced assumption-based bias**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Significance:**\n",
    "- Provides a **data-driven alternative** to estimating prescription durations.\n",
    "- Reduces reliance on arbitrary assumptions, enhancing the accuracy of **drug exposure assessments**.\n",
    "- Useful for **treatment adherence studies, safety evaluations, and effectiveness research**.\n",

    "## **Journal 2: A Newly Developed Method for Assessing Co-Exposure to Free-Dose Combinations: A Proof-of-Concept Study Using Antihypertensive Medications in Danish Registers**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Authors:**\n",
    "**Maria Antonietta Barbieri, Sidse Marie Neumann Nielsen, Andrea Rossi, Elena Olmastroni, Manuela Casula, Edoardo Spina, and Maurizio Sessa**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "- Develops a **novel method to assess co-exposure** to **free-dose combinations** of antihypertensive medications using Danish healthcare registries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Methods:**\n",
    "- Analyzed **1,021,819 individuals aged 65+** who initiated antihypertensive therapy between **1996 and 2016**.\n",
    "- Assessed co-exposure based on **redeemed prescriptions**, **treatment episodes**, and **overlapping medication events**.\n",
    "- **SEE was employed** to estimate prescription durations before computing co-exposure periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Findings:**\n",
    "- **100% accuracy** in identifying co-exposure periods.\n",
    "- **54.1% of individuals** were co-exposed to at least **two antihypertensive medications** in the first **180 days of treatment**, decreasing to **37.5% between 181–730 days**.\n",
    "- **Most frequently co-administered drugs:** **bendroflumethiazide + potassium with either amlodipine or enalapril**.\n",
    "- Temporal trends suggest **shifts in clinical guidelines and prescribing habits over time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Significance:**\n",
    "- Facilitates **precise tracking of multi-drug exposure**, crucial for evaluating **medication adherence, treatment effectiveness, and safety**.\n",
    "- Integration of SEE ensures **more accurate prescription duration estimation**, enhancing real-world medication use analysis.\n",

    "## **Journal 3: A Novel Approach for Pharmacological Substantiation of Safety Signals Using Plasma Concentrations of Medication and Administrative/Healthcare Databases**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Authors:**\n",
    "**Wenyi Wang, Vera Battini, Carla Carnovale, Raymond Noordam, Ko Willems van Dijk, Kristian Hay Kragholm, Diana van Heemst, Hiie Soeorg, and Maurizio Sessa**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "- Applies the **PHARMACOM-EPI framework** to predict **plasma concentrations of lamotrigine** and investigate its association with **cardiovascular mortality**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Methods:**\n",
    "- Analyzed **7,286 older adults** diagnosed with epilepsy and treated with **lamotrigine** using **Danish national health registries (1996–2018)**.\n",
    "- **SEE was used** to estimate medication duration and integrate pharmacometric models for plasma concentration predictions.\n",
    "- Patients were categorized into **toxic (>15 mg/L)** and **non-toxic (3-15 mg/L)** plasma concentration groups.\n",
    "- Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) were calculated to assess **mortality risk** between these groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Findings:**\n",
    "- **Toxic concentration group IRR = 3.37**, indicating a significantly higher **all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk**.\n",
    "- **Majority of deaths in the toxic group were cardiovascular-related**.\n",
    "- **Cumulative incidence of mortality** increased **exponentially** with plasma concentrations exceeding the therapeutic range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Significance:**\n",
    "- Confirms the necessity of **therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)** in older adults using lamotrigine.\n",
    "- Demonstrates how SEE and **PHARMACOM-EPI** can be integrated for **drug safety surveillance and pharmacovigilance research**.\n",
    "- Provides robust evidence supporting the **FDA’s warning on lamotrigine and cardiovascular risk**.\n",

    "## **What is the Sessa Empirical Estimator (SEE)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Functionality:**\n",
    "- A **machine learning-based method** for estimating prescription durations in cases where direct data is missing.\n",
    "- Uses **k-means clustering** to group prescription intervals and assign estimated durations based on real-world patterns.\n",
    "- Applied across multiple domains, including **drug safety, adherence research, and treatment effectiveness studies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Strengths:**\n",
    "- **Higher accuracy** than traditional **Researcher-Defined Duration (RDD) methods**.\n",
    "- **Minimizes assumption-based biases**, improving exposure classification.\n",
    "- Applicable to **automated, large-scale pharmacoepidemiological studies**.\n",
